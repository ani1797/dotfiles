# Wallpaper Configuration

## Directory

Place wallpapers in: `~/.config/wallpapers/`

Supported formats:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)

## Auto-Rotation

AGS automatically rotates wallpapers from this directory every hour.

## Manual Selection

To set a specific wallpaper, use the wallpaper service API (future: Quick Settings integration).

## Material You Colors

Colors are automatically extracted from the dominant color in each wallpaper.
Dark/light mode uses different tonal mappings from the same source color.

## Recommendations

- Use high-resolution images (1920x1080 or higher)
- Images with clear dominant colors work best for Material You
- Avoid overly busy or multi-colored images for best results
